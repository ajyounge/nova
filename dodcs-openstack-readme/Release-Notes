DODCS OpenStack Folsom Release
----------------------------------------
November, 2012

This DVD contains the Folsom release of the DODCS OpenStack distribution, which supports
heterogeneous, high-performance computing.  The Folsom release is based on a development
version of the Folsom version of OpenStack and is being provided to early adopters.  Subsequent
releases are expected to correlate with release versions of OpenStack, starting with Folsom.

The Folsom release supports single-node or multi-node installations with LXC and
KVM instances on x86, GPU, and SGI Altix UV100 platforms.

Known Issues
============
The following features have known issues:

 * VNC - can not get VNC consoles for instances from command line or from Horizon.
 * Resource overcommitting - For GPU provisioning, if all available GPUs are committed to 
   existing instances, then any attempt to provision another GPU
   should fail with an "Overcommitted" message. That is broken right now.
   GPU provisioning in the host is volatile in that the reservation of GPU resources is
   kept in the main memory. So, when nova-compute restarts on the host, the reservation
   information is lost. 
 * Tilera support has been tested but the images are not included. Please contact us to get the image.
 * Availability zones are not currently supported.
 * There are known compatibility issues with some EC2 commands, specifically:

   * Image management commands except euca-describe-images
   * Availability zone and region commands
   * euca-get-console-output
   * euca-create-snapshot
   * euca-bundle-instance
   * euca-authorize
   * euca-revoke
   * euca-confirm-product-instance
