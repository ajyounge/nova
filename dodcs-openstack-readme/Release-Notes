DODCS OpenStack Folsom Release
----------------------------------------
November, 2012

This DVD contains the Folsom release of the DODCS OpenStack distribution, which supports
heterogeneous, high-performance computing.  This release is based on the stable 
Folsom version of OpenStack. 

The Folsom release supports single-node or multi-node installations with LXC and
KVM instances on x86, GPU, and SGI Altix UV100 platforms.

Known Issues
============
The following features have known issues:

 * VNC - can not get VNC consoles for instances from command line or from Horizon.
 * Resource overcommitting - For GPU provisioning, if all the available GPUs are committed to 
   existing instances, then any attempt to provision another GPU
   should fail with an "Overcommitted" message. 
   There is a race condtion in the scheduler and this overcommitment is not always detected.
   It happens when multiple instances requesting GPUs are submitted simultaneously.
   GPU provisioning in the host is volatile in that the reservation of GPU resources is
   kept in the main memory. So, when nova-compute restarts on the host, the reservation
   information is lost and all the GPUs are ready for allocation. It doesn't prevent a running
   instance from accessing its allocated GPUs. But, it is possible to assign already allocated GPUs 
   to a new instance.
 * Tilera support has been tested but the images are not included. Please contact us to get the image.
 * Availability zones are not currently supported.

 * Some euca commands are not working:
   * Image management commands except euca-describe-images
   * euca-bundle-instance
   * euca-get-console-output
   * euca-modify-image-attribute
   * euca-confirm-product-instance
   * euca-authorize
   * euca-revoke
   * euca-create-snapshot
