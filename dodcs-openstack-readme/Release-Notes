DODCS OpenStack Essex Release
----------------------------------------
June, 2012

This DVD contains the Essex release of the DODCS OpenStack distribution, which supports
heterogeneous, high-performance computing.  The Essex release is based on a development
version of the Essex version of OpenStack and is being provided to early adopters.  Subsequent
releases are expected to correlate with release versions of OpenStack, starting with Essex.

The Essex release supports single-node or multi-node installations with LXC and
KVM instances on x86, GPU, and SGI Altix UV100 platforms.

Known Issues
============
The following features have known issues:

 * VNC - can not get VNC consoles for instances from command line or from Horizon.
 * Resource overcommitting - For GPU provisioning, if all available GPUs are committed to 
   existing instances, then any attempt to provision another GPU
   should fail with an "Overcommitted" message. That is broken right now. 
 * Tilera support has not been well-tested and images are not included.  
 * Availability zones are not currently supported.
 * There are known compatibility issues with some EC2 commands, specifically:

   * Image management commands except euca-describe-images
   * Availability zone and region commands
   * euca-get-console-output
   * euca-create-snapshot
   * euca-authorize
   * euca-revoke
   * euca-confirm-product-instance
