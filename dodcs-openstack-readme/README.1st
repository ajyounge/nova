DODCS OpenStack Folsom Release
-------------------------------------------
November, 2012

This DVD contains the Folsom release of the DODCS OpenStack distribution, which supports
heterogeneous, high-performance computing.  The Folsom release is based on a development
version of the Folsom version of OpenStack and is being provided to early adopters.  Subsequent
releases are expected to correlate with release versions of OpenStack, starting with Folsom.

Actual software is in the DODCS.iso file, and md5sum.txt contains the md5 checksum of the DODCS.iso
file so that the integrety of the disk image can be checked. Associated documentation is in the
dodcs-docs directory. For installation, start with the Installation Manual.

The three documents available in the dodcs-docs directory on this DVD are:

 * DODCS Installation Manual (InstallationManual.pdf): Provides detailed instructions on installing and
   configuring the DODCS distribution and is most useful for cloud administators. An appendix of this
   document lists the DVD contents.

 * User's Guide (UserGuide.pdf): Provides information for using the DODCS distribution and is most useful
   for cloud users.  This document also contains an appendix with known issues.

 * DODCS Architecture Document (Architecture.pdf): Provides an overview of the reference hardware
   architecture on which DODCS software is deployed at USC/ISI. This document supplements both the
   Installation Guide and the User Guide.

The Folsom release supports single-node or multi-node installations with LXC and
KVM instances on x86, GPU, and SGI Altix UV100 platforms.
