## Prerequisites:

Installation of the following rpms:
1) libyaml-0.1.3-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
2) MYSQL-Python (MySQL-python-1.2.3-0.3.c1.1.el6.x86_64.rpm)
3) python-yaml (PyYAML-3.10-3.el6.x86_64.rpm for CentOS 6.3)

## Configuring:
# The config.yaml file is a simple configuration file where parameters
  can be set by the user. The more important ones to get going are the
  ISO file names + paths.

  a) ISO Paths + Namesneed to be specified
  b) Correct eth port name (default eth0) but user needs to double check
  c) Other parameters can be left to the default values

## Running

# Clean:
$ clear; bash ./OS-install.sh -F config.yaml -T clean

# Create backup:
$ clear; bash ./OS-install.sh -F config.yaml -T backup

# To start install:
$ clear; bash ./OS-install.sh -F config.yaml -T all

# The -T option has the following supported options:
# -clean: removes/uninstalls openstack
# -cleanmysql: removes/deletes users + databases
# -backup: creates backup of some important config files in case installation goes wrong
# -restore: restores the backup files to allow for re-running of install script 
# -all: installs everything
# -S: Step to restart installation process from

Note: By default the kernel upgrade step is disabled. To enable kernel upgrade during Installation, specify the -K flag on the command line.

# Restarting the installation if step failures

# To restart the installation process from a certain step number, instead of from the beginning, use the -S flag.
# The following command restarts the installation process from step 12

$ clear; bash ./OS-install.sh -F config.yaml -T all -S 12 


# Post-Installation

   the image to the instance directory
